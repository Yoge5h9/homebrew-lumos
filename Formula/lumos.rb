# Homebrew formula skeleton for Lumos — a calm, ambient macOS menu-bar app
# that shows Claude Code's 5-hour usage window as a notch glow + menu-bar LED.
#
# This is a BUILD-FROM-SOURCE formula, not a cask: Homebrew compiles Lumos
# locally on the user's machine via Swift Package Manager. Because the binary
# is never downloaded prebuilt, macOS Gatekeeper never flags it — no
# "unidentified developer" prompt, no Apple Developer account, no
# notarization. See DISTRIBUTION.md in the main repo for the full rationale.
#
# This file lives in the separate `homebrew-lumos` tap repo
# (`Yoge5h9/homebrew-lumos`), not in the main Lumos repo.
#
# PLACEHOLDERS below must be filled in at the first tagged release — see the
# inline comments.

  # NOTE (revisit at release): the build only needs `swift build`, which is
  # green on a Command-Line-Tools-only machine (no full Xcode) — that light
  # install is a core selling point. `depends_on xcode` is the conventional
  # Homebrew way to guarantee the Swift toolchain, but may force a ~15 GB Xcode
  # install on users who only have CLT. Validate `brew install --build-from-source`
  # on a clean CLT-only machine at release and drop this to a CLT-only
  # declaration if it builds without full Xcode.
  depends_on xcode: ["14.0", :build] # supplies the Swift 5.9+ toolchain

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Lumos is installed but not yet wired up. Finish setup with:

        lumos setup

      This wires your Claude Code status line (non-destructively — your
      existing status line is backed up and wrapped, never replaced) so
      Lumos can read your 5-hour usage window locally. No network calls,
      no accounts, no API keys.

      To launch Lumos now:
        open #{opt_prefix}/Lumos.app

      To fully reverse setup later:
        lumos setup --uninstall
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # `lumos` is a long-running menu-bar agent with no CLI output today, so
    # the test only verifies the bundle assembled correctly rather than
    # invoking the binary (which would launch the app and hang the test).
    #
    # PLACEHOLDER: if/when a `--version` or `--help` flag is added to the
    # executable (Sources/lumos/main.swift), prefer asserting on its output
    # instead, e.g.:
    #   assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/lumos --version")
    assert_predicate prefix/"Lumos.app/Contents/MacOS/lumos", :exist?
    assert_predicate prefix/"Lumos.app/Contents/Info.plist", :exist?
